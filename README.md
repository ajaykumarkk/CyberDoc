# CyberDoc

Python based Tool for basic signature based Malware detection in drives,running process and some other critical sytem locations.


##Intoduction:

  People use computers for all kind of activities: online gaming, shopping, entertainment,
emails, face book, study, research, etc. At the same time, the risk of infection by malicious
programs in these computers is rising. Though the existing antivirus solutions do help to
prevent these attacks but they cannot classify or protect from zero day exploits and also
most antivirus solutions do not offer process based protection. Our intent is to demonstrate a proof of concept for such  an
endpoint security application which protects us against malicious internet traffic and also
protect from unknown malwares by using techniques like CDR(Content Disarming and
reconstruction) and Imp Hash Comparison.
